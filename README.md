* This is a project of mine done in C language for one of my cs courses.
* It is a tic-tac-toe game playable in a terminal.
* Compile the game.c using GCC (or any compiler of your choice) and run it in your terminal(linux and mac) or command prompt(win).
* I have included a list of issues i faced during development of this project and the solutions i used to solve them.

Cheers!
